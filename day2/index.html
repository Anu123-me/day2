  <h1 class="text-center"> KERALA TOURISM </i>  </h1>
  <p class="text-center">Kerala is a state in the Republic of India. It is in the south-west of the country. The west coast of the state is on the Arabian Sea.<br>
    Tamil Nadu and Karnataka are to the east.<br> The capital city of the state is Thiruvananthapuram, even though the city of Kochi is more densely populated.<br>Kerala's culture and traditions, coupled with its varied demographics, have made the state one of the most popular tourist destinations in India.<br> In 2012, National Geographic's Traveller magazine named Kerala as one of the "ten paradises of the world"[690][691] and "50 must see destinations of a lifetime".<br>[692] Travel and Leisure also described Kerala as "One of the 100 great trips for the 21st century".<br>[690][693] In 2012, it overtook the Taj Mahal to be the number one travel destination in Google's search trends for India.<br>[694] CNN Travel listed Kerala amongst its '19 best places to visit in 2019'.[695] Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the Worldâ€™s Greatest Places.[696]

    Kerala's beaches, backwaters, lakes, mountain ranges, waterfalls, ancient ports, palaces, religious institutions[697] and wildlife sanctuaries are major attractions for both domestic and international tourists.[698] The city of Kochi ranks first in the total number of international and domestic tourists in Kerala.[699][700] Until the early 1980s, Kerala was a relatively unknown destination compared to other states in the country.[701] In 1986 the government of Kerala declared tourism an important industry and it was the first state in India to do so.</p>
